## Legacy CMS

By popular demand (whenever I mention this project, people tend to express curiosity and a desire to explore the code), this is a Content Management System (CMS) that I developed in vanilla PHP during the 2000s in the confines of my bedroom. It could potentially serve as a training target or a CTF challenge. If you decide to use it, please let me know—I may or may not require credits.

## Changes from the Original

- Updated usernames and URLs.
- Replaced pictures I lacked the right to use with machine learning-generated images. Similar to the code, these replacements aim to stay true to the original.

## To-Do

- Ensure SQL.txt contains no personal data.
- Upload SQL.txt.
