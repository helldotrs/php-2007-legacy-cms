# Legacy CMS
On popular demand (when I mention this people tend to be curious and want to see the code)! This is a CMS that I wrote in vanilla PHP in my bedroom in 2000s. It could possibly be used as a training target/CTF - do let me know if you do use it - I may or may not want credits.

Minor changes has been made (usersnames/urls). SQL.txt will be uploaded once I've ensured there's no personal data in it.
